    <div class="box">The defects in requirement 4 were introduced during the definition of the
        requirements; the product has been designed and built to meet that flawed
        requirements definition. If we test the product meets its requirements and
        design, it will pass its tests but may be rejected by the user or customer. Defects
        reported by the customer in acceptance test or live use can be very costly.
        Unfortunately, requirements and design defects are not rare; assessments of
        thousands of projects have shown that defects introduced during requirements
        and design make up close to half of the total number of defects [Jones].
        What is the cost of defects?
        As well as considering the impact of failures arising from defects we have not
        found, we need to consider the impact of when we find those defects. The cost
        of finding and fixing defects rises considerably across the life cycle; think of the
        old English proverb 'a stitch in time saves nine'. This means that if you mend a
        tear in your sleeve now while it is small, it's easy to mend, but if you leave it, it
        will get worse and need more stitches to mend it.
        If we relate the scenarios mentioned previously to Figure 1.2, we see that, if
        an error is made and the consequent defect is detected in the requirements at
        the specification stage, then it is relatively cheap to find and fix. The observation of increasing defect-removal costs in software traces back to [Boehm].
        You'll find evidence for the economics of testing and other quality assurance
        activities in [Gilb], [Black 2001] or [Black 2004]. The specification can be corrected and re-issued. Similarly if an error is made and the consequent defect
        detected in the design at the design stage then the design can be corrected and
        re-issued with relatively little expense. The same applies for construction.
