how to work with git
git clone url <folder name>
input some changes
ctrl + s
git status                 (red color marked files wich was changed)
git add -A
git status                 (green color marked all changed files)
git commit -a -m"six work commit"
git push


pull you should use  if you need download last changes which was added from another workplace 


if you add some changes directly on GitHub and not pull it after you see nex error
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/labkapapka/Test3.git'/...
you need use git pool before
